## Introduction

A React Typing library.

## Reasons:

There are already other well known Typing libraries that do their job, are well mantained and have been used for years now, so why the need for another library ?
I found the existing libraries not offering the flexibility and customizability I needed so I decided to write one from scratch.

Purely React based, two hundreds lines of code, fast, light, composable, easy API.
The main idea is to be able to compose complex typing sequences, with "yoyo" effects, custom delays, custom CSS styling for each segment, custom cursors, etc... etc... Without having to instantiate multiple Components.
You just render one `<TypeAnimation text={textSequence} />` and textSequence is gonna be an array containing all the text and settings you wanna dynamically type.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save react-typing
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn add react-typing
```

## Usage

Check the `example` folder for a comprehensive example of how to import and use the React Component in your application.

This is as simple as doing:

```javascript
const MyComponent = () => <TypeAnimation text={textSequence} />;
```

## API / Props

| Props       | Default value | Required | Type   |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------- | ------ | --- |
| text        | undefined     | true     |  (IText \| ITypeAnimation \| number)[] \| [] |
| repeat      | 0             | false    | number |
| repeatDelay | 1000          | false    | number |

## Types

```javascript
interface ITypeAnimation {
	text: (IText | ITypeAnimation | number)[] | [];
	repeat?: number;
	repeatDelay?: number;
}

interface IText {
	content: string;
	tag?: string;
	delay?: number; // speed of typing
	yoyo?: boolean;
	cursor?: string;
	cursorDelay?: number;
	cursorColor?: string;
	[key]: string;
}
```

This is the example app props passed to the Component:

```javascript
const typingText = [
	{
		content: 'This is',
		className: styles.text1,
	},
	500,
	{
		content: 'react-typing',
		className: styles.text2,
	},
	{
		content: 'a React Typing Library!',
		className: styles.text1,
	},
	500,
	// This is how you set up a multiple sequence nested in the typing timeline.
	// You can use it to nest infinite repeat yoyo sequences for examples or whatever you like
	{
		text: [
			{
				content: 'Fast',
				className: styles.text3,
				tag: 'span',
				yoyo: true,
			},
			{
				content: 'Highly Customizable',
				className: styles.text3,
				tag: 'span',
				yoyo: true,
			},
			{
				content: 'Composable',
				className: styles.text3,
				tag: 'span',
				yoyo: true,
			},
		],
		repeat: -1,
		repeatDelay: 1000,
	},
	500,
	{
		content: 'Hope you like it!',
		className: styles.text1,
	},
];

```

As you can see you can customize any chunk of the sequence singularly, they are gonna be executed sequentially, you can decide if some chunk has to perform a *yoyo* animation, you can style them by using standard JSX attributes `className` and inline `style` . You can pass whatever event listener or any other attribute, it'll end up on the element.

If you wish to nest in the sequential typing animation another typing animation with its own lifecycle, you can easily pass an object of type `ITypeAnimation` instead of `IText`, it's gonna work out of the box with no overhead since in that case it calls itself recursively.
